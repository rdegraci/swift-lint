Cyclomatic complexity is determined by the number of
linearly independent paths through a program's source code.
In other words, cyclomatic complexity of a method is measured by
the number of decision points, like `if`, `while`, and `for` statements,
plus one for the method entry.

The experiments McCabe, the author of cyclomatic complexity,
conclude that methods in the 3 to 7 complexity range are
quite well structured. He also suggest
the cyclomatic complexity of 10 is a reasonable upper limit.

###### Example 1

```
func example(a: Int, b: Int, c: Int) // 1
{
    if (a == b)                      // 2
    {
        if (b == c)                  // 3
        {
        }
        else if (a == c)             // 3
        {
        }
        else
        {
        }
    }
    for i in 0..<c                   // 4
    {
    }
    switch(c)
    {
        case 1:                      // 5
            break
        case 2:                      // 6
            break
        default:                     // 7
            break
    }
}
```

## High NPath Complexity

NPath complexity is determined by the number of execution paths through that method.
Compared to cyclomatic complexity, NPath complexity has two outstanding characteristics:
first, it distinguishes between different kinds of control flow structures;
second, it takes the various type of acyclic paths in a flow graph into consideration.

Based on studies done by the original author in AT&T Bell Lab,
an NPath threshold value of 200 has been established for a method.
